# typescript-node-seed
> TypeScript seed project that focusses on using npm scripts to do all the work

## WARNING

I'm just dabbling around with TypeScript and have no idea what I'm doing :)   

## What's working (I think!)

* npm run clean
* npm run build
* npm run repl
* npm test
* npm run watch


## TODO

### npm run test:watch
This works mostly, but stuff that makes the TypeScript compiler blow up leads to watch not properly refreshing source files. Currently you have to change a test to get that properly reloaded.
### npm run lint
Add tslint as script and maybe before test/build etc
