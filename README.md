# typescript-node-seed
> TypeScript seed project that focusses on using npm scripts to do all the work

## WARNING

I'm just dabbling around with TypeScript and have no idea what I'm doing :)   

## What's working (I think!)

* npm run build
* npm run build:watch
* npm run clean
* npm run lint
* npm run repl
* npm test
* npm test:watch

## TODO

Probably some stuff I'm not seeing right now.
